# My-project

> A Vue.js project

The client is build with the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) framework.
Routing is implemented with [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/) and state management is implemented
with [vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/).  Assets are bundled using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000

### Vue Chrome Dev Tool

The Vue chrome dev tools [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd?hl=en)
allows for inspection of component and Vuex state.  It also
offers a great time travelling feature to relive state mutations.

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
